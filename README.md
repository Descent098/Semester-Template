# Semester-Template
A template repo to setup a university semesters worth of course. Follow the TODO list below to get everything setup, and fork the Repo to suit you if you want to create your own template. **KEEP IN MIND, by default the .gitignore file makes the system ignore everything kept in the following folders:** ```
/Assignments    /Handouts    /Readings``` see the last point in the **course todo** for details on how to get this to work.


## TODO
- [ ] Add course list to [Courses section](#courses)
- [ ] Delete unnecessary months from [Assignment due dates & Important dates](#assignment-due-dates--important-dates) & the [Table of contents](#table-of-contents)
- [ ] Add an image of your schedule (as a .png file) to the main directory and call it ```schedule.png``` or delete that section
- [ ] Add each course as a directory following the template under ```/CODE-111; This is where the course name goes``` & fill out it's readme.

## Courses

CODE-111; This is where the course name goes

## Schedule

![Schedule](./schedule.png)

I would recommend adding a image of your schedule in the main directory. Call it schedule.png and it will show up here automatically.

## Assignment due dates & Important dates

You can use any format for this section, but I would recommend going in order of what's due, and then [striking through](https://saijogeorge.com/strikethrough-text-generator/) as you complete the assignments.
